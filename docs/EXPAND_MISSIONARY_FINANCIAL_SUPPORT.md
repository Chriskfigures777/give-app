|-------|---------|
| **Sending organization partnerships** | Partner with mission agencies; they onboard missionaries to Give |
| **Missionary onboarding flow** | Simple signup, clear value prop ("Get support from churches in one place") |
| **Invite from nonprofit** | Nonprofit invites missionary; missionary gets pre-linked sponsored embed |
| **Referral** | Missionary refers another missionary; small incentive (e.g. badge, visibility) |
| **Content / SEO** | "Missionary support platform," "Church support for missionaries" |
| **Events** | Mission conferences, church leadership events — demo and signup |

| **Reduce friction** | Saved missionaries, one-click give, Apple Pay / Google Pay |
| **Recurring** | Encourage churches to set up monthly support; predictable for missionary |
| **Year-end campaigns** | Promote year-end giving; tax receipts, deadlines |
| **Nonprofit adoption** | Nonprofits bring missionaries; each missionary = more volume |
